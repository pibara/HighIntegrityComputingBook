High Integtity Computing
========================

This repository contains some attempts at porting my old and currently still abandoned work on a book on ''High Integrity Computing'' to the epub3 format.
My previous attempts were abandoned as a result of the clumsy math rendering in google docs, where I was wotking on this book. Porting to LaTex turned out to be to tedious a job, so now I'm trying out if epub3 with its (aparently not yet broadly implemented) MathML and SVG support can bring some hope of resurrecting the project. If your interested in my work, please don't get your hopes up yet, I'm currently experimenting with my chapter two content (a chapter on set theory and boolean algebra) that contains some basic math expressions that are interesting to test MathML with and some karnaugh diagrams that are interesting to test SVG with. If these experiments work out, the project might be resurrected.
